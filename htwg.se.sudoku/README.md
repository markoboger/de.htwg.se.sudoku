Main goal of the application is to demonstrate the development of a software project in an agile development methodology. 

It shows 
* version control with git 
* test driven development
* layered architecture
* metrics with sonar
* continuous integration with maven and jenkins

The initial user interface is a console-based text UI. Its purpose is to be able to interact with the application as early as possible. 
The Tui is built in a way so that it continues to run in parallel with a GUI or WUI.
